# [V3.13](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues?q=milestone%3A3.13)


* [453](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues/453) handle null value for jOOQ unsigned types
* [450](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues/450) add option to have root types - Integer, Long etc.. - to map in order for tuples, need to add more doc for that one.
