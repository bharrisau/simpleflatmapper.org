# [V3.12](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues?q=milestone%3A3.12)

Main goal of 3.12 was to support mapping of [Google Protocol Buffers objects](https://github.com/google/protobuf).

They were a few bug in the meta data building, and messy arbitrage between property mapping that needed to be fixed for it to work properly.


All you need to do now is add sfm-converter-protobuf to your dependencies, to be able to instantiate `com.google.protobuf.Timestamp`.

```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.simpleflatmapper</groupId>
        <artifactId>sfm-converter-protobuf</artifactId>
        <version>{% include currentversion.html %}</version>
    </dependency>
```
see [sfm-test-proto](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/tree/master/sfm-test-proto) for running code.
